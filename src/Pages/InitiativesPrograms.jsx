      INITIATIVES AND PROGRAMS  
      </h1>
      <p>
      Teens Literacy Foundation runs on a pre-planned annual calendar from January every year till December. There are fixed initiatives that run yearly with modifications each year, and there are occasional events that the foundation carries out based on needs available to be met. Below are our fixed initiatives and programs
      <ul>
        <li>1.	Project 1000Saviours
Often, many have asked questions on how to avert the societal problems the world, especially Nigeria, is plagued with. As an organization, we have discovered that the core of the issues is the leadership problem. Leadership does not refer to being in government houses but coordinating, instructing, reasoning, and executing proper thoughts and abilities. This program targets pupils and teenagers and aims to recruit as many as possible to our leadership academy, where teaching and mentorship are. Adequate exposure will also be provided to this young generation on the tenets of leadership, what leadership is, and what leadership is not, to foster nation-building and solve crises across every aspect that leadership spreads. </li>

2.	Teach a Subject/Topic Campaign
According to Sustainable Development Goal 4, our foundation aims to ensure inclusive and equitable education and promote lifelong learning opportunities for all. We achieve this through various projects across schools, within and without the four walls of the classroom. However, for education to be inclusive and sustainable, parents, teachers, administrators, and students must receive adequate support in every way possible. Therefore, this project aims to achieve three purposes:
a.	Provide external hands to schools and teachers in handling specific subject(s) or topic(s) in the subject taught in schools
b.	Temporarily relieve teacher(s) for the period(s) of the subject, so they could recuperate, recharge and become more efficient in their roles and duties.
c.	Expose our volunteers to educational needs to achieve SDG 4 and how to contribute locally and globally to this sustainable goal.
Our volunteers are adequately up to the task of imparting knowledge in their preferred subject of interest, even though not all have formal teachers’ training. </li>

3.	SACRAF: Students Arts and Crafts Fest
SACRAF is an annual students’ festival set up by the Teens Literacy Foundation to encourage young minds gifted in Arts and Crafts. The festival enjoys partnerships from corporate bodies and individuals, parastatals, and various government ministries. Students would be encouraged to come up with original work, and a grand event marks the end of the festival where exceptional Arts work would be recognized, appreciated, and rewarded. </li>
        <li> 4.	The Next Innovator
This science-driven social impact project focuses on developing critical thinking and problem-solving skills in pupils and students. This project also embraces SDG 9, which focuses on building resilient infrastructure, promoting inclusive and sustainable industrialization, and fostering innovations. The role of science and technology in solving myriads of man’s problems cannot be overemphasized. However, there is still a long way to go regarding industrialization and innovation, especially in Nigeria and Africa. This project will help to broaden the mind of our young scientists and innovators in secondary school. It will include support of economic development and human beings, increased insight and access to small-scale industrial innovation, and taking action according to available capabilities. </li>

5.	TWALP: The Woman, Advocacy, Leadership, and Policy
This initiative focuses on achieving gender equality and empowers all women and girls in line with SDG 5. This program will encourage the participation of girls (who would go on to become women) in leadership and challenge them to get involved in policy-making and various advocacy opportunities. The project also aims at providing relevant support for the girl-child in fulfilling her dreams.

6.	TGH: Teenagers Global Health
Our organization conducts research projects, collates primary data from community participants, and executes projects that directly address health promotion through preventing and reducing Non-Communicable Diseases (NCDs). Our campaigns involve reducing the prevalence of sedentary living, substance addiction-related diseases, and other lifestyle health challenges in our communities of interest. In addition, we have developed self-help programs, rehabilitation support, and interventions to address these issues. Our flagship project involved educating high school students and other young people in the communities of engagement on mental wellness and handling suicidal tendencies. Our organization aims to solve problems through literacy and education on a wide range of life, social and wellness issues faced by teenagers and youth through integrative practical life experiences within the community rather than theoretical dogma.
